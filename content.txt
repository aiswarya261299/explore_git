OWASP Vulnerabilities list includes the following issues.
1. Broken object level authorization
Object level authorization, typically implemented at the code level for user validation, is a control method to restrict access to objects. When authorization at the object level is not properly enforced, it can expose systems. Such a vulnerability was uncovered at Uber by sending API requests including user phone numbers to get access to tokens and manipulating systems.
2. Broken authentication
Authentication endpoints are vulnerable to a number of risks, including brute force attacks, credential stuffing, weak encryption keys, and connections to other microservices without requiring authentication.
3. Broken object property level authorization
When accessing an object via an API, users must be validated to ensure they have the authority to access certain object properties. Broken authorization at the object property level can allow unauthorized users to access and change objects.
4. Unrestricted resource consumption
Without restrictions on API requests, attackers sending multiple requests or flooding resources can implement denial of service (DoS) attacks and also cause financial damage for those using pay-per-request billing. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have grown significantly over the past two years, up as much as 60%.
5. Broken function level authorization
When function level authorization allows users to access administrative endpoints, they can perform sensitive actions.
6. Server side request forgery
Server side request forgery (SSRF) can happen when an API fetches a remote resource without first validating the URL supplied by users. Servers can be used as proxies to hide malicious activity. Researchers recently found four such instances of SSRF vulnerabilities with Azure API management, which have since been patched.
7. Security misconfiguration
Hardening security for the API stack should be a top priority for developers, but permissions are often improperly, or inconsistently, applied across cloud services. In other cases, security patches and software are out of date. There have been several high-profile instances where companies failed to protect their cloud resources properly, such as the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command, and in that case the unprotected data included some files classified as top secret.
8. Lack of protection from automated threats
Cybercriminals and other threat actors are increasingly evolving their tactics, and APIs are prime targets. Automation is cheap and widely available on the dark web. The APIs themselves may not have flaws or bugs, but the underlying business flow may be vulnerable to excessive activity.
9. Improper inventory management
APIs across applications can be quite complex and interwoven. Connectivity with third parties increase threat exposure, and often multiple versions of APIs may be left running that are unmanaged. Outdated or missing documentation can make it challenging to keep track of everything.
10. Unsafe consumption of APIs
When working with well-known third parties and suppliers, you can generally trust the data you receive and might employ less stringent security standards. Yet, if threat actors can breach third parties, they may be able to cause damage through APIs that connect you. Today, as many as half of data breaches occur because of third-party connectivity.
In addition these are more vulnerabilities:
1. Broken Access Control
This vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's authentication or authorization mechanisms. For example, an attacker might be able to bypass login requirements or gain access to restricted areas by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability.
2. Cryptographic Failures
This vulnerability allows attackers to steal or decrypt sensitive data. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's cryptographic algorithms or implementations. For example, an attacker might be able to crack a password hash or decrypt a database by exploiting a weak cryptographic algorithm.
3. Injection
This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into a web application, which can then be executed by other users. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's input validation mechanisms. For example, an attacker might be able to inject a malicious JavaScript code into a web form, which would then be executed by other users when they submit the form.
4. Insecure Design
This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit design flaws in a web application, such as using predictable data formats or failing to implement input validation. This can lead to a variety of security problems, including data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and privilege escalation attacks. For example, an attacker might be able to exploit a predictable data format to predict the values of input fields, which could then be used to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.
5. Security Misconfiguration
This vulnerability occurs when security settings are not properly configured, which can allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. This can include misconfigured firewalls, web servers, and databases. For example, an attacker might be able to exploit a misconfigured firewall to bypass security controls and gain access to a web application.
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
This vulnerability occurs when outdated or vulnerable components are used in a web application, which can allow attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities. This can include outdated web frameworks, libraries, and plugins. For example, an attacker might be able to exploit a known vulnerability in an outdated web framework to gain access to a web application.
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
This vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to a web application by bypassing authentication or session management mechanisms. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's login page, session management, or password hashing mechanisms. For example, an attacker might be able to bypass the login page by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability or gain access to a session by exploiting a session hijacking vulnerability.
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
This vulnerability allows attackers to modify or delete sensitive data, which can lead to data loss or corruption. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's data access layer, data validation mechanisms, or data encryption mechanisms. For example, an attacker might be able to modify sensitive data by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability or delete sensitive data by exploiting a data tampering vulnerability.
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
This vulnerability occurs when security logs are not properly configured or monitored, which can make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents. This can include not logging important events, not monitoring logs for suspicious activity, or not having a process for responding to security incidents. For example, an attacker might be able to exploit a security vulnerability without being detected if security logs are not properly configured or monitored.
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
This vulnerability allows attackers to make requests to arbitrary URLs on the server, which can be used to steal data or launch denial-of-service attacks. For example, an attacker might be able to exploit an SSRF vulnerability to make a request to a database server and steal sensitive data.

Given a program, provide the details of the vulnerabvility and the corresponding fixes. For example,  buffer overrun attack in C++ looks like this:
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   char buffer1[5] = "Hello";
   char buffer2[5];
   // Copy buffer1 to buffer2
   strcpy(buffer2, buffer1);
   cout << "Buffer2: " << buffer2 << endl;
   return 0;
}
while the fixed version looks like 
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   char buffer1[5] = "Hello";
   char buffer2[5];
   // Copy buffer1 to buffer2 with bounds checking
   strncpy(buffer2, buffer1, sizeof(buffer2));
   cout << "Buffer2: " << buffer2 << endl;
   return 0;
}
In this fixed program, strncpy function is used instead of strcpy. strncpy copies the string from buffer1 to buffer2, but it also performs bounds checking by checking the size of the destination buffer buffer2 before copying the data. By using strncpy with bounds checking, we prevent buffer overflow attacks by ensuring that the data being copied is not larger than the destination buffer.
